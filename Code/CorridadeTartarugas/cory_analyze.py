And he sent his angel to present it in signs through him to his slave John, who bore witness to the word God gave and to the word Jesus Christ gave, yes, to all the things he saw. Happy is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words in this prophecy, and who observe the things written on it, for the appointed time is near. """)
